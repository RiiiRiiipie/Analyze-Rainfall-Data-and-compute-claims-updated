# Analysis of the Rainfall to find the claims 
## This the updated part where i have tackled the outliers in a differnt way as well as the method of computing the claims has been changed 
## Here i have consider the outlier as a missing value and i have tired to fill that value using the most simplest way i.e to fill it with the mean of the remaining data
## By doing this we have found the same result i.e the same number of claims but because of using differnt method to obatin the claim amount the anount is different
# usign Ml to tackle the missing value (just an overview)
## we can use different ml models to predict the missing value or we can treat the missing values a new value and predict that using the differnt ml models 
## Like regression model , Logistic regression model , knn model and other supervised model to predict the value
